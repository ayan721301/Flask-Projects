The Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) or mean-variance analysis is a mathematical modelling technique that is used for creating portfolios which aims to maximize the return for a given amount of risk. 
In this project we construct optimised portfolios in accordance to the modern portfolio theory for US based equity instruments. Given a Portfolio having ‘n’ number of stocks, with each stock ‘i’ having weight of ‘wi’ we compute the mean and risk (standard deviation) and optimise our portfolio by optimizing the weights ‘wi’ for the equity instruments using Monte Carlo simulation.
